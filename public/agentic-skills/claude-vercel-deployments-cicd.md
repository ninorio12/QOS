# Vercel Deployments & CI/CD

You are an expert in Vercel deployment workflows — `vercel deploy`, `vercel promote`, `vercel rollback`, `vercel inspect`, `vercel build`, and CI/CD pipeline integration with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Bitbucket Pipelines.

## Deployment Commands

### Preview Deployment

```bash
# Deploy from project root (creates preview URL)
vercel

# Equivalent explicit form
vercel deploy
```

Preview deployments are created automatically for every push to a non-production branch when using Git integration. They provide a unique URL for testing.

### Production Deployment

```bash
# Deploy directly to production
vercel --prod
vercel deploy --prod

# Force a new deployment (skip cache)
vercel --prod --force
```

### Build Locally, Deploy Build Output

```bash
# Build locally (uses development env vars by default)
vercel build

# Build with production env vars
vercel build --prod

# Deploy only the build output (no remote build)
vercel deploy --prebuilt
vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod
```

**When to use `--prebuilt`:** Custom CI pipelines where you control the build step, need build caching at the CI level, or need to run tests between build and deploy.

### Promote & Rollback

```bash
# Promote a preview deployment to production
vercel promote <deployment-url-or-id>

# Rollback to the previous production deployment
vercel rollback

# Rollback to a specific deployment
vercel rollback <deployment-url-or-id>
```

**Promote vs deploy --prod:** `promote` is instant — it re-points the production alias without rebuilding. Use it when a preview deployment has been validated and is ready for production.

### Inspect Deployments

```bash
# View deployment details (build info, functions, metadata)
vercel inspect <deployment-url>

# List recent deployments
vercel ls

# View logs for a deployment
vercel logs <deployment-url>
vercel logs <deployment-url> --follow
```

### Project Binding + Alias Verification

Before claiming a deployment is final, verify that the local workspace is linked to the intended Vercel project and that the production alias points to the new deployment. Do not trust the workspace path, old session memory, or the URL printed by `vercel deploy` alone.

If Hermes profile isolation causes `vercel whoami` to say no credentials while deployments have worked from the VPS before, check both the profile-scoped config and the real user config before asking the user to login:

```bash
vercel whoami || true
find ~/.local/share/com.vercel.cli /home/hermes/.local/share/com.vercel.cli -maxdepth 1 -type f -name 'auth.json' -print 2>/dev/null
XDG_DATA_HOME=/home/hermes/.local/share vercel whoami
```

If the last command works, deploy with the same prefix:

```bash
XDG_DATA_HOME=/home/hermes/.local/share vercel deploy --prod --yes --public
```

Do not claim Vercel is unavailable until this config-path check is done.

```bash
cat .vercel/project.json 2>/dev/null || echo "not linked"
vercel ls
vercel inspect <intended-production-alias>
```

Checklist:
- Confirm `.vercel/project.json` `projectName` matches the intended project, especially when repos/workspaces have similar names (`qos`, `vividflow`, etc.).
- After deploy, inspect the public alias, not only the generated deployment URL. The generated URL may be protected or may belong to the wrong linked project.
- Smoke-test the alias routes with `curl -L`, then scan recent logs with `vercel logs <alias> --since 5m`.
- If the deploy target is wrong, relink with `vercel link` or fix `.vercel/project.json` before redeploying; do not announce success from a wrong-project deployment.

## CI/CD Integration

### Required Environment Variables

Every CI pipeline needs these three variables:

```bash
VERCEL_TOKEN=<your-token>        # Personal or team token
VERCEL_ORG_ID=<org-id>           # From .vercel/project.json
VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=<project-id>   # From .vercel/project.json
```

Set these as secrets in your CI provider. Never commit them to source control.

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
name: Deploy to Vercel
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install Vercel CLI
        run: npm install -g vercel

      - name: Pull Vercel Environment
        run: vercel pull --yes --environment=production --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}

      - name: Build
        run: vercel build --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}

      - name: Deploy
        run: vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
```

### OIDC Federation (Secure Backend Access)

Vercel OIDC federation is for **secure backend access** — letting your deployed Vercel functions authenticate with third-party services (AWS, GCP, HashiCorp Vault) without storing long-lived secrets. It does **not** replace `VERCEL_TOKEN` for CLI deployments.

**What OIDC does:** Your Vercel function requests a short-lived OIDC token from Vercel at runtime, then exchanges it with an external provider's STS/token endpoint for scoped credentials.

**What OIDC does not do:** Authenticate the Vercel CLI in CI pipelines. All `vercel pull`, `vercel build`, and `vercel deploy` commands still require `--token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}`.

**When to use OIDC:**
- Serverless functions that need to call AWS APIs (S3, DynamoDB, SQS)
- Functions authenticating to GCP services via Workload Identity Federation
- Any runtime service-to-service auth where you want to avoid storing static secrets in Vercel env vars

### GitLab CI

```yaml
deploy:
  image: node:20
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - npm install -g vercel
    - vercel pull --yes --environment=production --token=$VERCEL_TOKEN
    - vercel build --prod --token=$VERCEL_TOKEN
    - vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod --token=$VERCEL_TOKEN
  only:
    - main
```

### Bitbucket Pipelines

```yaml
pipelines:
  branches:
    main:
      - step:
          name: Deploy to Vercel
          image: node:20
          script:
            - npm install -g vercel
            - vercel pull --yes --environment=production --token=$VERCEL_TOKEN
            - vercel build --prod --token=$VERCEL_TOKEN
            - vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod --token=$VERCEL_TOKEN
```

## Common CI Patterns

### Preview Deployments on PRs

```yaml
# GitHub Actions
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npm install -g vercel
      - run: vercel pull --yes --environment=preview --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
      - run: vercel build --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
      - id: deploy
        run: echo "url=$(vercel deploy --prebuilt --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }})" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
      - name: Comment PR
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            github.rest.issues.createComment({
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              body: `Preview: ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.url }}`
            })
```

### Promote After Tests Pass

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy-preview:
    # ... deploy preview ...
    outputs:
      url: ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.url }}

  e2e-tests:
    needs: deploy-preview
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: npx playwright test --base-url=${{ needs.deploy-preview.outputs.url }}

  promote:
    needs: [deploy-preview, e2e-tests]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - run: npm install -g vercel
      - run: vercel promote ${{ needs.deploy-preview.outputs.url }} --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
```

## Global CLI Flags for CI

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--token <token>` | Authenticate (required in CI) |
| `--yes` / `-y` | Skip confirmation prompts |
| `--scope <team>` | Execute as a specific team |
| `--cwd <dir>` | Set working directory |

## Best Practices

1. **Always use `--prebuilt` in CI** — separates build from deploy, enables build caching and test gates
2. **Use `vercel pull` before build** — ensures correct env vars and project settings
3. **Prefer `promote` over re-deploy** — instant, no rebuild, same artifact
4. **Use OIDC federation for runtime backend access** — lets Vercel functions auth to AWS/GCP without static secrets (does not replace `VERCEL_TOKEN` for CLI)
5. **Pin the Vercel CLI version in CI** — `npm install -g vercel@latest` can break unexpectedly
6. **Add `--yes` flag in CI** — prevents interactive prompts from hanging pipelines

## Deployment Strategy Matrix

| Scenario | Strategy | Commands |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Standard team workflow | Git-push deploy | Push to main/feature branches |
| Custom CI/CD (Actions, CircleCI) | Prebuilt deploy | `vercel build && vercel deploy --prebuilt` |
| Monorepo with Turborepo | Affected + remote cache | `turbo run build --affected --remote-cache` |
| Preview for every PR | Default behavior | Auto-creates preview URL per branch |
| Promote preview to production | CLI promotion | `vercel promote <url>` |
| Atomic deploys with DB migrations | Two-phase | Run migration → verify → `vercel promote` |
| Edge-first architecture | Edge Functions | Set `runtime: 'edge'` in route config |

## Project-Scope Discipline

When the user asks for a direct Vercel deployment of a local app/path, keep the scope to deployment only. Do **not** switch into GitHub repository linking, Git push, or CI setup unless the user explicitly asks for it. If the user corrects “only deploy to Vercel,” immediately drop all repo-linking commentary and continue with deploy verification only.

If `vercel deploy --prod` attempts/complains about GitHub linking but still starts a deployment, treat GitHub linking as non-blocking for direct CLI deploys. Verify the deployment status with `vercel inspect`/`vercel ls`; if the remote build queues or stalls, use the prebuilt path:

```bash
NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096 npx vercel build --prod --yes
npx vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod --yes
curl -I -L https://<alias-or-url>/<critical-route>
npx vercel inspect https://<alias-or-url>
```

For Jonathan/Thomas handoffs, report only: live URL, status, critical route smoke result, and any unrelated errors clearly marked as unrelated.

## Common Build Errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE` | Lockfile doesn't match package.json | Run `pnpm install`, commit lockfile |
| `NEXT_NOT_FOUND` | Root directory misconfigured | Set `rootDirectory` in Project Settings |
| `Invalid next.config.js` | Config syntax error | Validate config locally with `next build` |
| `functions/api/*.js` mismatch | Wrong file structure | Move to `app/api/` directory (App Router) |
| `Error: EPERM` | File permission issue in build | Don't `chmod` in build scripts; use postinstall |
| Failed to collect page data for /api/... with missing env vars | Next/Vercel imports route modules during build; top-level clients call runtime secrets too early | Lazy-initialize SDK clients inside handlers/functions, or add build-safe placeholders only for `NEXT_PHASE=phase-production-build`; prefer configuring real Vercel env vars for runtime |
| `JavaScript heap out of memory` during local/remote Next build | Typecheck/trace/build exceeds Node's default heap, often after adding many routes/server functions | Re-run once with `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096 npm run build`; if confirmed, encode it in the build script or CI env before redeploying |

## User Communication for Auth/Deploy Hand-offs

When Jonathan needs to perform an auth step (`vercel login`, OAuth confirmation, token setup), do not lead with infrastructure detail. Give one exact command to paste, then 2-4 short validation steps. After he says it is connected, immediately verify with `vercel whoami` and continue the deployment.

## Reusable References

- `references/next-runtime-env-build-trap.md` — Next/Vercel build failures caused by route/page modules importing runtime secrets too early; includes lazy-client and build-placeholder patterns.
- `references/production-final-verification.md` — final-deployment verification loop: project binding, local build/tests, deploy, alias inspect, smoke routes, and fresh log scan before claiming completion.

## Deploy Summary Format

Present a structured deploy result block:

```
## Deploy Result
- **URL**: <deployment-url>
- **Target**: production | preview
- **Status**: READY | ERROR | BUILDING | QUEUED
- **Commit**: <short-sha>
- **Framework**: <detected-framework>
- **Build Duration**: <duration>
```

If the deployment failed, append:

```
- **Error**: <summary of failure from logs>
```

For production deploys, also include:

```
### Post-Deploy Observability
- **Error scan**: <N errors found / clean> (scanned via vercel logs --level error --since 1h)
- **Drains**: <N configured / none>
- **Monitoring**: <active / gaps identified>
```

## Deploy Next Steps

Based on the deployment outcome:

- **Success (preview)** → "Visit the preview URL to verify. When ready, run `/deploy prod` to promote to production."
- **Success (production)** → "Your production site is live. Run `/status` to see the full project overview."
- **Build error** → "Check the build logs above. Common fixes: verify `build` script in package.json, check for missing env vars with `/env list`, ensure dependencies are installed."
- **Missing env vars** → "Run `/env pull` to sync environment variables locally, or `/env list` to review what's configured on Vercel."
- **Monorepo issues** → "Ensure the correct project root is configured in Vercel project settings. Check `vercel.json` for `rootDirectory`."
- **Post-deploy errors detected** → "Review errors above. Check `vercel logs <url> --level error` for details. If drains are configured, correlate with external monitoring."
- **No monitoring configured** → "Set up drains or install an error tracking integration before the next production deploy. Run `/status` for a full observability diagnostic."
